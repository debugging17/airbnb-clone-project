# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform **AirBnB**.  
It aims to provide users with the ability to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings in a responsive, user-friendly environment.

## Project Goals
- Implement responsive and accessible UI/UX designs.
- Build a scalable, component-based frontend architecture.
- Develop backend APIs and integrate with a database.
- Practice team collaboration using version control best practices.
- Deploy the application to a live environment.

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Design Tools:** Figma for UI/UX design
- **Deployment:** Vercel / Netlify (frontend), Render / Railway (backend)

## üé® UI/UX Design Planning

### **Design Goals**
- Create an intuitive and seamless booking flow.
- Maintain visual consistency across all pages.
- Ensure fast loading times for a smooth experience.
- Prioritize mobile-first responsive design.
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to ensure inclusivity.

### **Key Features**
- Property search with filters (location, price, amenities, etc.).
- Detailed property viewing with multiple images and descriptions.
- Secure and streamlined checkout process.
- User authentication for bookings and favorites.
- Responsive navigation and consistent UI components.

### **Primary Pages**
| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a grid of available properties with search and filter options. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows complete property details including high-quality images, amenities, price, reviews, and booking form. |

### **Importance of User-Friendly Design**
A user-friendly booking system reduces friction in the customer journey, leading to higher conversion rates and better user satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive layouts make it easier for users to search, evaluate, and complete bookings quickly. A well-designed interface builds trust, encourages repeat usage, and supports accessibility for all users.
